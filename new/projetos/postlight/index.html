		<h1>Dear Postlight,</h1>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p class="intro">When I remembered having well explained projects on my portfolio but that there’s a small chance that any of you would understand the language in which the projects were written, three layers of despair came to light:</p>
		<div class="layer-of-despair">
			<h2>1. Show <a href="https://www.behance.net/matiazzo">my portfolio</a> anyway</h2>
			<p>Most projects are from the time when I worked only with traditional graphic design, such as visual identities and editorial projects. What I want to show you here is my knowledge of the basics of design: typography, visual hierarchy and use of color.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="layer-of-despair">
			<h2>2. Show my recent-but-not-on-portfolio work</h2>
			<p>These are the projects in which I participated as a designer-front-end (is this still a thing?) and the ones that helped me to discover how much joy exists in the world that goes beyond visual and structural aspects of web projects.</p>
			<div class="sublayer-of-despair">
				<h3><a href="http://www.andrematiazzo.com/playkids">PlayKids</a></h3>
				<p>Besides been able to create a non childish identity for a children’s app site, this project allowed me to wrap my head around some responsive behaviors for different elements of the website (it was the first time that I worked with responsive iframes, for example). I’m showing this on my own domain because the code was adapted to a CMS by the client, who didn’t know exactly how to do it. You can imagine how it went.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sublayer-of-despair">
				<h3><a href="http://www.diatipo.com.br/campinas">DiaTipo</a></h3>
				<p>This one page website was designed for a brazilian event about typography with the theme “Typography’s Intersections”. The layout follows the thought behind the brand drawing, so it vertically “divides” the website in half. It was another playground to think about responsive elements.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="layer-of-despair">
			<h2>3. Show a work in progress</h2>
			<p>What I want to show you here is a snippet of the thinking behind my most recent project. I was used to only do this on projects in which I saw the need to rationalize some abstract concept like “brand personality”. By explaining and revisiting my thinking, I not only got more approval by clients but I also began to discover some gaps early on the project.</p>
			<div class="sublayer-of-despair">
				<h3><a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/e70369fd-39e7-4c0b-9510-95631a7e95db">Freshtime</a></h3>
				<p>Currently, my role on this project is to help people that are having trouble to understand the service and to identify different types of plans on the website. Also, I was asked to create a visual identity for it that is aligned with the brand concept. This presentation shows what I was thinking during the creation of a proposal for the homepage.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="goodbye">
			<p>The anxiety capable of producing a quick list to resolve a language barrier between me and you is the same one capable of blocking me when I'm finishing that same list: “How am I going to finish this in the same kinda-funny way that I started?”</p>
			<p>Hope to see you soon, <span>André</span></p>
